Presented in no particular order:
*	*The Elements of Typographic Style* by Robert Bringhurst (2012). Often called the typographer’s bible, ... Bringhurst also wrote a wonderful little book on Palatino called *Palatino: The natural history of a typeface.*
*	*Practical Typography* by Matthew Butterick (2018). I stated earlier that there are few hard-and-fast rules for typography. Where such rules exist, you can trust Butterick to catalog and explain them. There is a heavy focus on document design, which has a particular set of needs and constraints, and favors correctness over expressivity. Thus, not every recommendation can be followed verbatim in interface designs. Butterick is not only a user but also a designer of type, and his typefaces offer exceptional value at $119 each. Notably, his Valkyrie typeface is inspired by Aldus, which designer Hermann Zapf created as a sister face to Palatino.

## Online resources

*	Typewolf is an excellent online resource for finding typographic inspiration, created by Jeremiah Shoaf. It consists of a curated selection of websites, arranged by the fonts they use. You can search for a particular font and see how others are using it and what other fonts they’re pairing it with, or you can browse through the “Site of the Day” archives to find a style to emulate. Shoaf also maintains lists of the most popular fonts featured on Typewolf, as well as his personal favorite fonts; and he offers premium guides to different font services, type pairing lookbooks, and an online typography course presented in the form of an interactive checklist. It’s one of the first places I look for type inspiration. A word of warning: Typewolf uses a sim-plified classification schema in which Humanist and Garalde serifs are lumped together under the moniker “oldstyle”, and there is no designation for Clarendons. As a result, it often miscategorizes Garalde and Clarendon typefaces as transitional, or Clarendons as slab serifs.
